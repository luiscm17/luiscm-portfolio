## Overview
**Drilling Efficiency & Risk Analysis** is a data-driven analysis project designed to optimize drilling operations by predicting Rate of Penetration (ROP), detecting operational anomalies, and identifying critical safety risks like gas influx. Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **Dash**, the solution provides actionable insights through predictive modeling, real-time alerts, and interactive visualizations.

**Lead Data Analyst** and **Machine Learning Engineer**

## ‚ùì Problem
The drilling team faced these challenges:  
1. **Inefficient Operations**: Difficulty predicting ROP under varying downhole conditions.  
2. **Safety Risks**: Manual monitoring of pressure (PRESS) and gas (GAS) events led to delayed responses.  
3. **Anomaly Detection**: No systematic method to identify abnormal drilling patterns (e.g., low ROP with high WOB).  
4. **Data Overload**: Raw sensor data lacked actionable insights for decision-making.

---

## üéØ Goal
1. Develop a **predictive model** for ROP with < 10% error to optimize drilling parameters.  
2. Detect **operational anomalies** in real time (e.g., pressure spikes, gas influx).  
3. Build an **interactive dashboard** to visualize trends, risks, and model outputs.

## ‚ú® Solution

### Understanding Stakeholder Needs  
Interviews with drilling engineers and safety teams revealed:  
- **Accuracy**: Models must account for depth-dependent variables (e.g., ECD, WOB).  
- **Actionability**: Alerts for pressure thresholds and gas events need to be intuitive.  
- **Usability**: Dashboards should simplify complex data for field teams.

### Core Features
1. **ROP Prediction**:  
```python
# XGBoost ROP Model
model = XGBRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
Achieved 8.5% MAPE using WOB, RPM, and depth.
2. Anomaly Detection:
```python
# Z-Score Thresholding
df['Anomaly'] = (df['ROP_residual'] < -2.5) & (df['WOB'] > df['WOB'].quantile(0.95))
```
3. Interactive Dashboard:
```python
# Dash Visualization
app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Graph(id='depth-trends'),
    dcc.Interval(id='live-update', interval=10*1000)
])
```

### Analytical Process
1. Data Preprocessing:
    * Winsorization to handle sensor outliers without losing depth continuity.
    * Rolling averages to smooth noise in ROP and PRESS.
2. Model Development:
    * Trained and validated XGBoost (MAPE: 8.5%) and Random Forest models.
    * SHAP analysis to interpret feature importance (WOB ‚âà 35%, RPM ‚âà 25%).
3. Optimization:
    * Bayesian Optimization to recommend safe WOB-RPM-FLOW IN combinations (PRESS < 800 psi).
4. Dashboard:
    * Real-time alerts for PRESS > 800 psi and TEMP_OUT anomalies.
    * Gas event mapping correlated with depth and pressure changes.

## üîç Key Insights
1. **ROP Drivers:**
```python
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)  # WOB and RPM dominate
```
2. **Gas Events:**
    * 78% occurred at depths >1,500m.
    * Average pressure increase: 12% during gas influx.
3. **Anomalies:**
    * 5% of operations showed unsafe ROP-WOB combinations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Learnings
1. **Sensor Noise:** Addressed with rolling window averaging.
```python
df['PRESS_smoothed'] = df['PRESS'].rolling(window=5, center=True).mean()
```
2. **Model Trust:** Used SHAP values to explain predictions to engineers.
3. **Dashboard Latency:** Optimized Dash callbacks for real-time use.

## ‚ú® Final Thoughts
1. Impact:
    * 15% ROP improvement in test wells.
    * 30% reduction in pressure-related incidents.
2. Future Work:
    * Integrate real-time sensor APIs.
    * Add lithology-based adaptive models.
